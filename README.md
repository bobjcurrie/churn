# Analyzing Employee Attrition
## January 26, 2022

***

The aim of this project is to analyze HR employee data to see what factors may contribute to an employee leaving a company, and to build a model to predict employee attrition.  

The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

The analysis is made up of two components:  

1. A report which details the steps of data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory and detailed data analysis, and model building.

2. An executive presentation for stakeholders explaining the findings of the analysis and making recommendations
